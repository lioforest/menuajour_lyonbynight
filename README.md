# Readme. Menu à Jour


Hello and Welcome to this app’s repository. 
This app was developed by Lionel FOREST, Noël GAGNAIRE, Cédric ROBERT, Baptiste VEYRARD & Anne-Tahina METZ. 
We developed it as our final project for The Hacking Project (https://www.thehackingproject.org).

As you can imagine, some Chefs are not the best when it comes to computers and editing their menus as they change their dishes (seasonally, monthly or even daily sometimes). It can be a real burden for them to do it and manage to have a neat layout using a simple text editor (like Word on Windows or Pages on Mac).

« Menu à jour » is an app that allows restaurant, wine cellars and other hospitality businesses to update their menus more simply and quickly, without having to go through external companies, this makes the task less expensive as well. 

In this app, the establishments can create an account, add a menu ( « Summer 2018 » for exemple), add all the dishes stored in different categories (starters, main course, cheese, desserts, drinks etc.) and edit them using a template. Once they are satisfied with their menu, they can download a PDF version of it and then print it. The application then store the menu in it’s database so they can go back to it at any time and keep a trace of their past menus. 
BUT (there is always a but in good stories, isn’t there), in order to be able to download the PDF, the user need to subscribe and pay a fee.
